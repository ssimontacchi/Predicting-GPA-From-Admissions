# can-admissions-predict-GPA
Takes years of admissions and GPA data and cleans, merges, and analyzes it using a Random Forest

While the academic and admissions data has been altered to maintain confidentiality, I decided
that it would be best not to even make the altered files available, as making up matching pseudonyms
for each student would be too much work.

Still, I hope that the process is fascinating. Now, if only Bokeh graphs would show up on github...
