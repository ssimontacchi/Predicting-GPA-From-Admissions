While the academic and admissions data has been altered to maintain confidentiality, I hope that the process is still fascinating. 

Also, please take a look at the presentation I gave the faculty for my full analysis. Again, the results
have been edited for the purposes of confidentiality.

Random Forest with feature analysis is a technique that every admissions staff should be performing to determine if their practices aline with their goals and ideals.

Thank you!
