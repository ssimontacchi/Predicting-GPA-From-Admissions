# can-admissions-predict-GPA
Takes years of admissions and GPA data from different services and databases and cleans, merges, and analyzes it using a Random Forest.

While the academic and admissions data has been altered to maintain confidentiality and the csv has been removed, I hope that you still find reading about the process fascinating. 

Also, please take a look at the presentation I gave the faculty for my full analysis. Again, the results
have been edited for the purposes of confidentiality.

Random Forest with feature analysis is a technique that every admissions staff should be performing to determine if their practices align with their goals and mission.

Thank you!
